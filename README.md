# Adapter-Core

Core module to be used in ioBroker adapters. Acts as the bridge to js-controller.

This replaces the `utils.js` included in the ioBroker template adapter.

## Usage

1. Add this as a dependency: `npm i @iobroker/adapter-core`
2. Replace
    ```js
    const utils = require(__dirname + '/lib/utils');
    ```
    with
    ```js
    const utils = require('@iobroker/adapter-core');
    ```
3. Create an adapter instance as usual:
    ```js
    // old style
    const adapter = utils.adapter(/* options */);
    // new style (classes). See https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.template/ for a more detailed usage
    class MyAdapter extends utils.Adapter {...}
    ```

## Utility methods

Compared to the old `utils.js`, some utility methods were added.

### `getAbsoluteDefaultDataDir`

```js
const dataDir = utils.getAbsoluteDefaultDataDir();
```

This returns the absolute path of the data directory for the current host. On linux, this is usually `/opt/iobroker/iobroker-data`

### `getAbsoluteInstanceDataDir`

```js
// old style
const instanceDataDir = utils.getAbsoluteInstanceDataDir(adapter);
// new style (classes)
const instanceDataDir = utils.getAbsoluteInstanceDataDir(this);
```

Returns the absolute path of the data directory for the current adapter instance.
On linux, this is usually `/opt/iobroker/iobroker-data/<adapterName>.<instanceNr>`

### `EXIT_CODES`

```js
adapter.terminate('for some reason', utils.EXIT_CODES.ADAPTER_REQUESTED_TERMINATION);
```

Use standardized exit codes if your adapter needs to terminate.

### `commonTools`

A collection of various utility methods and modules from JS-Controller. Prefer this over trying to find `lib/tools.js` and similar internal modules from the controller yourself!

Currently, the following **methods** are available:

-   `commonTools.pattern2RegEx` - Converts a pattern to match object IDs into a RegEx string that can be used in `new RegExp(...)`
-   `commonTools.getAdapterDir` - Finds the adapter directory of a given adapter
-   `commonTools.getInstalledInfo` - Get a list of all installed adapters and controller version on this host
-   `commonTools.getLocalAddress` - Get the localhost (IPv6 or IPv4) address according to the ioBroker config
-   `commonTools.getListenAllAddress` - Get the "listen all" (IPv6 or IPv4) address according to the ioBroker config
-   `commonTools.isLocalAddress` - Check if given IPv4 or IPv6 ip address corresponds to localhost
-   `commonTools.isListenAllAddress` - Check if given IPv4 or IPv6 ip address corresponds to "listen all" address
-   `commonTools.ensureDNSOrder` - Ensure that DNS resolution is performed according to ioBroker config

And the following **modules** are exposed:

-   `commonTools.password` - Previously exposed as `lib/password.js` in JS-Controller.
-   `commonTools.session` - Previously exposed as `lib/session.js` in JS-Controller.
-   `commonTools.zipFiles` - Previously exposed as `lib/zipFiles.js` in JS-Controller.
-   `commonTools.isDocker` - Checks if we are running inside a docker container

Note that `commonTools.letsEncrypt` is not available anymore as the next controller won't support it (use `@iobroker/webserver` instead).

## I18n

Developer can use internationalisation in backend.

For that call

```javascript
const I18n = require('@iobroker/adapter-core').I18n;

// later in "ready" method
await I18n.init(__dirname, adapter);
// If you use class syntax, you can use `this` instead of `adapter`
await I18n.init(__dirname, this);
// You can provide the language directly
await I18n.init(__dirname, 'de');
```

and then in code

```javascript
console.log(I18n.translate('text to translate %s', 'argument1'));
// or to get the ioBroker.Translated object
console.log(JSON.stringify(I18n.getTranslatedObject('text to translate %s and %s', 'argument1', 'argument2')));
```

You can place your `i18n` folder in root of adapter or in `lib` folder. If your `i18n` files are in `lib` directory, so call the `init` function like this:

```javascript
const { join } = require('node:path');
const I18n = require('@iobroker/adapter-core').I18n;

await I18n.init(join(__dirname, 'lib'), adapter);
```

Expected structure of `i18n` directory

```
+ i18n
  - de.json
  - en.json
  - es.json
  - fr.json
  - it.json
  - nl.json
  - pl.json
  - pt.json
  - ru.json
  - uk.json
  - zh-cn.json
```

And an example of i18n files could be found [here](test/i18n/de.json)

## Automatic backup of data files

ioBroker has the ability to include files written by adapters in its backups. To enable that, you need to add the following to `io-package.json`:

```json5
{
    // ...
    "common": {
        // ...
        "dataFolder": "path/where/your/files/are"
    }
}
```

This path is relative to the path returned by `getAbsoluteDefaultDataDir()`. The placeholder `%INSTANCE%` is automatically replaced by the instance number of each adapter, for example `"dataFolder": "my-adapter.%INSTANCE%"`.

## Tips while working on this module

-   `npm run build` creates a clean rebuild of the module. This is done automatically before every build;
-   `npm run lint` checks for linting errors;
-   `npm run watch` creates an initial build and then incrementally compiles the changes while working.

## Errors in the definitions?

If you find errors in the definitions, e.g., function calls that should be allowed but aren't, please open an issue here or over at https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped and make sure to mention @AlCalzone.
