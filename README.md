# Adapter-Core

Core module to be used in ioBroker adapters. Acts as the bridge to js-controller.

This replaces the `utils.js` included in the ioBroker template adapter.

## Usage

1. Add this as a dependency: `npm i @iobroker/adapter-core`
2. Replace
    ```js
    const utils = require(__dirname + "/lib/utils");
    ```
    with
    ```js
    const utils = require("@iobroker/adapter-core");
    ```
3. Create an adapter instance as usual:
    ```js
    // old style
    const adapter = utils.adapter(/* options */);
    // new style (classes). See https://github.com/ioBroker/ioBroker.template/ for a more detailed usage
    class MyAdapter extends utils.Adapter {...}
    ```

## Utility methods

Compared to the old `utils.js`, some utility methods were added.

### `getAbsoluteDefaultDataDir`

```js
const dataDir = utils.getAbsoluteDefaultDataDir();
```

This returns the absolute path of the data directory for the current host. On linux, this is usually `/opt/iobroker/iobroker-data`

### `getAbsoluteInstanceDataDir`

```js
// old style
const instanceDataDir = utils.getAbsoluteInstanceDataDir(adapter);
// new style (classes)
const instanceDataDir = utils.getAbsoluteInstanceDataDir(this);
```

Returns the absolute path of the data directory for the current adapter instance.
On linux, this is usually `/opt/iobroker/iobroker-data/<adapterName>.<instanceNr>`

### `EXIT_CODES`

```js
adapter.terminate(
	"for some reason",
	utils.EXIT_CODES.ADAPTER_REQUESTED_TERMINATION,
);
```

Use standardized exit codes if your adapter needs to terminate.

## Automatic backup of data files

ioBroker has the ability to include files written by adapters in its backups. To enable that, you need to add the following to `io-package.json`:

```json
{
	// ...
	"common": {
		// ...
		"dataFolder": "path/where/your/files/are"
	}
}
```

This path is relative to the path returned by `getAbsoluteDefaultDataDir()`. The placeholder `%INSTANCE%` is automatically replaced by the instance number of each adapter, for example `"dataFolder": "my-adapter.%INSTANCE%"`.

## Tips while working on this module

-   `npm run build` creates a clean rebuild of the module. This is done automatically before every build
-   `npm run lint` checks for linting errors
-   `npm run watch` creates an initial build and then incrementally compiles the changes while working.
